## Pipeline

This project includes a CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions.

Checks for every push on a pull request or the the main branch:

- Linting & Formatting using ESLint
- Lines of code are measured
- Unit tests using Vitest including coverage (>80%)
- E2E tests using Cypress
- Lighthouse report (>80%)
- SonarCloud static code analysis (A-Marks)
- On the main branch: Website is deployed

The dependencies between the pipelines are as follows:
